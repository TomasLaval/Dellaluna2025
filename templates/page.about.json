A world where tradition isn’t preserved in glass, but made to live and move through modern life.</p><p>From the beginning, Dellaluna has been about creating objects with soul — not just handbags, but heirlooms of emotion and memory. Rooted in heritage, guided by instinct, and shaped by beauty, each piece speaks to a way of living: slower, deeper, and with intention.</p>",

Once a residence for merchants journeying between East and West, the palazzo has long been a hub of culture, refinement, and worldly exchange. Known as the Palace of the Moon, its name reflects the poetic meeting point between the crescent moon of the East and the full moon of the West — a symbol of balance, mystery, and movement.</p>",

The first piece wasn’t just a bag, but a fragment of a place, a memory made tangible. There was no marketing plan, no PR strategy. Everything went into the object: its soul, its symbolism, its detail. And maybe that was the secret. The right people found it — collectors, editors, connoisseurs. It appeared in the Louis Vuitton Guide, and quietly began to travel. Dellaluna is no longer just Silvia’s. It’s a world of its own, created for those who see beauty as a form of meaning.</p>",
